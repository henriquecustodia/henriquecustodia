  🤓 I've been working as a frontend developer for years and I really like to use Angular and Vue in my projects. 

  ❤️ Oh, I love TypeScript as well! Thus, I always try using it in my projects. 

  📖  I'm currently focusing on creating content about frontend at my blog and, also, studying new technologies to create amazing apps.
