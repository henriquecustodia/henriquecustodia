   ## About me

  - 🤓 I like to use Angular for big projects and Vue for crafting ideas. 

  - ❤️ Oh, I love TypeScript! I use it in everything. 
  
  - 🤔  I believe that, some day, the world will speak Typescript rather than English.

  - 📖  I write posts about what I'm studing lately and tips related to home office. [Check it out](https://codedimension.com.br/) 🔗
  
  - 🧑‍🎓 Spent weekends studyng new stuffs is my hobby.
